# Made a Basic Cloud Wallet for Solana
*Loved to code the Backend of generating the private key of solana and storing into the mongo(as os now no any Private key management done , i.e. Just done) In future can do use the Multisigs
and Sharding concepts Butfor now this is just a wallet created in the website for quick interaction in the solana devnet server.

as of now i added :
keypair generation logic (without serializing)
signing the transaction from the backend (as db holds private key)
validating the transaction 

Here there is zero need of wallet and all . Was thinking of Building th BonkBot kinda thingee in the Telegram But just explored this to gain some backend logics of the web3.js 
used :
ALCHEMY FOR DEVNET URL
DOCKER FOR MONGO INSTANCE
POSTMAN FOR THE REST APIS
FAUCET FOR SOLANA AIRDROP*
